# Introduction 
- This is a project that I created for making a desktop chat application. 
- It works as a server/client application. This means that one of the users acts as a server and waits for a connection request to send and receive the data. The other user acts as a client and sends the request to start the communication. 
- I chose C# as the programming language and I used WinForms for the UI. 
- For sending and receiving packets between the server and the client I used TCP/IP protocols.

You can also check out the related Azure DevOps project page to learn more about the project management methodology that I used using this [link](https://dev.azure.com/aihsanelmas/Text-Me). You can also watch this [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf07IfG6YNY) to see how the application works.

# Getting Started
- Solution consists of 2 separate projects for server and client UI, 1 unit test project for 2 user stories, 1 library project for the logic behind the UI, and 1 User Controller project for creating reusable UI elements.
- You can pull and start playing with the project. It doesn't require any additional steps other than having Visual Studio 2019 or a newer version.
